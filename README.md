# Smart E-VANET For Scheduling and Communication
**Objective:**

- Develop a reliable E-VANET system for real-time communication among electric vehicles, traffic infrastructure, and management centers.
- Implement intelligent scheduling and AI-based algorithms to optimize electric vehicle routes considering traffic conditions, energy consumption, and charging station availability.
- Enhance traffic management by providing real-time traffic information, congestion alerts, and alternative route suggestions to drivers.
- Improve energy efficiency by deploying energy-efficient communication protocols and smart scheduling strategies for electric vehicles.
- Ensure data security and privacy measures to protect transmitted information within the E-VANET system using blockchain.
